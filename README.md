Exploring Different format, starting with png

## PNG

Started with a PNG encoder, managed to do IHDR, PLTE, TRNS, IDAT (multiple even though not usefull without compression nor filtering apparently), IEND

Next step could be a decoder or try and do the optional fields, also compression and filtering should be good to do
